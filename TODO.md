# Login Page OTP Implementation - Task Progress

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Updated Login Component Structure
- Added OTP mode toggle alongside password mode
- Implemented conditional rendering for different login modes
- Added OTP step states: 'idle', 'sending', 'sent', 'verifying'

### 2. Form Field Management
- Password field now only shows for password mode
- OTP code field appears only when OTP is sent
- Updated form validation to handle both modes appropriately
- Email validation works for both password and OTP modes

### 3. OTP Flow Implementation
- **Send OTP Button**: Appears when OTP mode is selected and step is 'idle'
  - Validates email before sending
  - Shows loading state during sending
  - Transitions to 'sent' state on success

- **Verify OTP Button**: Appears after OTP is sent
  - Allows user to enter OTP code
  - Validates OTP code before verification
  - Shows loading state during verification
  - Redirects to photobooth on successful verification

### 4. UI/UX Improvements
- Different colored buttons for different OTP states:
  - Blue for "Send OTP"
  - Green for "Verify OTP"
  - Gray for loading states
- Smooth animations and transitions between states
- Clear visual feedback for each step

### 5. State Management
- Proper state cleanup when switching between modes
- Error handling for failed OTP operations
- Form data reset when toggling between sign in/register

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Variables Added:
- `loginMode`: 'password' | 'otp'
- `otpStep`: 'idle' | 'sending' | 'sent' | 'verifying'

### New Functions:
- `handleSendOtp()`: Sends OTP to user's email
- `handleVerifyOtp()`: Verifies entered OTP code
- Updated `validateForm()`: Handles validation for both modes

### Conditional Rendering:
- Password field: `{isLogin && loginMode === 'password'}`
- OTP code field: `{isLogin && loginMode === 'otp' && otpStep !== 'idle'}`
- OTP buttons: `{isLogin && loginMode === 'otp'}`
- Submit button: `{(!isLogin || loginMode === 'password')}`

## Integration with AuthContext
- Uses existing `sendOtp()` and `verifyLoginOtp()` functions
- Maintains compatibility with existing password-based login
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- **Dynamic 5-Digit OTP Generation**: Now generates random 5-digit codes (10000-99999) for each email
- **OTP Storage**: Codes are stored temporarily and cleared after successful verification
- **Console Logging**: Generated OTP codes are logged to console for testing purposes

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test password mode login (existing functionality)
2. Test OTP mode: Send OTP → Enter code → Verify
3. Test mode switching between password and OTP
4. Test form validation for both modes
5. Test error scenarios (invalid email, wrong OTP, etc.)
6. Test responsive design on different screen sizes

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/Login.tsx`: Main implementation

All tasks completed successfully! The login page now supports both password and OTP authentication modes with a smooth user experience.
